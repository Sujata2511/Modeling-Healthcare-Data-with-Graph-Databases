# Modeling-Healthcare-Data-with-Graph-Databases
The transition from paper records to virtual records, hospitals have been piling up data. Every touchpoint of the healthcare system, every prescription, operation, and immunization, is logged and stored in the hospitalâ€™s electronic health record (EHR). Data in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) is not only large, but also closely related to the others. Graphs are perfect for storing and visualizing healthcare data. Here the usage of a graph database such as Neo4j to store, manage and query medical data often serves the purpose of building a backbone for a web application with easy user access. 
Neo4j uses Cypher as the query language, Cypher is a descriptive query language, which does not need to write the traversal code of the graph structure to carry out efficient traversal queries.
The query efficiency of graph database Neo4j is significantly higher than that of relational database, and the difference is at least 10 times.
